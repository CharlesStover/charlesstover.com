        <p>Charles has been extremely effective in collaboration and brainstorming design solutions and then translating them into fully developed products. His full-stack knowledge and expertise help guide my design decisions as they relate not only to the functional aspects of the product, but with the user experience as well. As a Designer, I would highly recommend working with Charles. He has proven time and again that he is reliable, adaptive and intuitive while offering constructive feedback and the necessary positive friction that results in the creation of a high quality product.</p>
        <p>Charles is passionate about his work and never fails to meet whatever challenge comes his way. His leadership and “Nothing is impossible” mentality towards development is infectious and inspires myself and the others within the team to do their best.</p>

    quote:'When Charles started working for the Career Development Center, I knew quickly that we had gotten very lucky in hiring him. Charles has a lot of experience working in web development; for us, this translated to him not only working through assignments quickly, but also letting us know areas we could improve our website. I was his direct supervisor, but I had no background in web development at that point. Charles did an incredible job of explaining technical issues and opportunities with me so that we could decide the best course of action for moving forward. His desire to improve the website and his ability to communicate complex technical issues to non-technical people really impressed me. I would recommend Charles to any employer - he is a real asset!'

        <p>In short: Charles is an efficient, knowledgeable and trustworthy individual.</p>
        <p>To elaborate: I've had the pleasure of employing Charles' services many times over the past 15 years on projects requiring skills ranging from Frontend and Backend Development to SEO and Technical Writing. He always meets deadlines. His experience makes it so he can not only perform but also advise on any task put before him and can lead a team as exceptionally as he can be part of one. Charles receives my highest recommendation and any company would be lucky to have him.</p>
