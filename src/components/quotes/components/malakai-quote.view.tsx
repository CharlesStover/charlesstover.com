        In short: Charles is an efficient, knowledgeable and trustworthy
        individual.
      </Box>
      <Box variant="p">
        To elaborate: I’ve had the pleasure of employing Charles’s services many
        times over the past 15 years on projects requiring skills ranging from
        Frontend and Backend Development to SEO and Technical Writing. He always
        meets deadlines. His experience makes it so he can not only perform but
        also advise on any task put before him and can lead a team as
        exceptionally as he can be part of one. Charles receives my highest
        recommendation and any company would be lucky to have him.
