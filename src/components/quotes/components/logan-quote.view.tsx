        I was very privileged to be Charlesâ€™ manager for a brief period of time.
        During that time, Charles demonstrated that he is an extremely gifted
        JavaScript developer; but beyond that, he demonstrated that he is a
        principled, driven individual. Charles cared deeply about JavaScript and
        React and was a great part of our local community, as well as the
        JavaScript community at large. He was always a good mentor to others and
        a good teammate. The thing that impressed me most about Charles is that
        he always sought feedback and he always wanted to get better, both as a
        person and a developer.
