      When Charles started working for the Career Development Center, I knew
      quickly that we had gotten very lucky in hiring him. Charles has a lot of
      experience working in web development; for us, this translated to him not
      only working through assignments quickly, but also letting us know areas
      we could improve our website. I was his direct supervisor, but I had no
      background in web development at that point. Charles did an incredible job
      of explaining technical issues and opportunities with me so that we could
      decide the best course of action for moving forward. His desire to improve
      the website and his ability to communicate complex technical issues to
      non-technical people really impressed me. I would recommend Charles to any
      employer - he is a real asset!
