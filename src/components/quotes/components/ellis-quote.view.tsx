        Charles has been extremely effective in collaboration and brainstorming
        design solutions and then translating them into fully developed
        products. His full-stack knowledge and expertise help guide my design
        decisions as they relate not only to the functional aspects of the
        product, but with the user experience as well. As a Designer, I would
        highly recommend working with Charles. He has proven time and again that
        he is reliable, adaptive and intuitive while offering constructive
        feedback and the necessary positive friction that results in the
        creation of a high quality product.

        Charles is passionate about his work and never fails to meet whatever
        challenge comes his way. His leadership and “Nothing is impossible”
        mentality towards development is infectious and inspires myself and the
        others within the team to do their best.
